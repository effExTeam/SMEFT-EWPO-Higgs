# Write title here -- eg. Exploring BSM parameter space using global SMEFT fits

This repository presents the supplementary material of the article arxiv:{put here}.

Brief abstract: We present constraints on the SMEFT dimension-6 Wilson coefficients for multiple Beyond Standard Model scenarios in both model parameter dependent and independent manner by means of global Bayesian inference utilising the up-to-date electroweak precision observables and the Higgs signal strengths from LHC Run-I and II. We compare the constraints on the SMEFT coefficients obtained from the model parameter dependent and independent analysis and show the differences in the allowed regions. The global fit on SMEFT Wilson coefficients is updated.
